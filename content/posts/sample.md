Everything has a beginning, and my dev journey didnâ€™t start in an office. It began in the heart of the Swiss Alps, chasing steep roads alongside professional riders, shooting bike campaigns and summer races.

After long days in the saddle, we would dive into our GPS and performance data, geeking out over switchbacks, gradients, and the segments we regularly called "kneebreakers."

Cyclists are among the most data-obsessed athletes out there. They measure everything. And so do I. Thatâ€™s how I started exploring ways to collect, compare, and visualize Switzerlandâ€™s most iconic mountain passes.

This is the prologue to that journey.

Long climbs give me goosebumps.

Thereâ€™s something iconic about conquering a mountain pass on a road bike. Itâ€™s hard to put into words, you have to suffer through it to really get it.

Because mountain passes carry a kind of magic.


Theyâ€™re places of glaciers, springs, and watersheds. Places where borders and old smuggler routes intersect. But also where languages and cultures rub their shoulders. You can jump from swiss german to french, to italian and rumantsch. And yeah: they usually smell somewhat of old fryer grease.

A mountain pass is also a kind of anthropological study. Up on the peak youâ€™ll find people on vintage bikes, sleepy tour groups, classic car lovers, petrolheads, hikers, influencers, YouTubers, geologists, birdwatchers.. and a wide range of professional and less-than-professional picnickers. Every now and then, someone stumbles out of a car mid-serpentine because their stomach just canâ€™t take it anymore.

Even as a kid, mountain passes had a certain magic for me. The roads were long, steep, and often seriously exposed. Crossing from one canton to another felt like collecting bonus points. Like a loyalty program for geography nerds (like meâ€¦).

I mustâ€™ve been around seven, completely obsessed with those Swiss canton stickers youâ€™d find at every gas station. Four cantonal emblems in a single day? Jackpot.

I think the obsession came from my grandfather. A sheet metal wizard from Madrid, with good cologne, crisp shirts, and always a picnic blanket in the trunk of his Ford Mustang. Back then, one of his favourite roads, the Furka Pass, was wild, mostly gravel, full-on Annapurna vibes. He used to drive up there often.

Passes arenâ€™t places you stay long. If youâ€™re cycling up, you stop just briefly. Otherwise, youâ€™ll cool down too fast. Most people just pause for a quick selfie.

A pass ride feels like a fresh sauna infusion.

Sweat, euphoria, and bliss wrapped in a red face and the sting of metaphorical birch branch lashes. Pain and reward go hand in hand. Push too far, and youâ€™ll end up walking your bike. Cooling off the hard way.
